# Examples of patterns

Please take a look at the `Client` class for each pattern to see how it is used.

*Note: The examples are without validation and should not be used as it is.*

## Principles

Remember, principles are not mandatory rules but guidelines.

Fail fast. <br>
Do validation as early as possible.

One return statement <br>
Only one return statement per function, multiple returns may be overlooked.

Less is more. <br>
Remember to be explicit - Do not confuse it with shortened code which is not necessarily more readable.

Just in time. <br>
Start small and transparent. Use patterns when requirements changes, to make it more maintainable. You do not have to begin with a pattern.

Example: "XML Http Request" becomes "XmlHttpRequest" not "XMLHTMLRequest"
